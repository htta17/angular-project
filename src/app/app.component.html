<h1>Profile</h1>

<p>Hi all! My name is Anh Hoang, I created this portal with Angular to present my profile, show some DYI projects (making tables, benches, gardening) or play with kids.</p>
<p>This site is being developed during my free time, so right now it doesn't look good.</p>

<p>My Github: <a href="https://github.com/htta17">https://github.com/htta17</a></p>


<p>This page uses Angular, and API service is in <a href="https://anhhoang.life">https://anhhoang.life</a>, with NodeJS (Express). Both sites are deployed in Azure</p>

<p>Some techniques I am using:</p>

<ul>
  API
  <li>NodeJS</li>
  <li>MongoDB for database</li>
  <li>AWS SES for sending email to me</li>
  <li>Swagger for Documentation</li>
  <li>Apache Kafka/Flink for streaming. What content? I don't know, will be need one. lol</li>
  <li>Azure Web App for CI/CD</li>
</ul>


<ul>UI
  <li>Angular 17</li>
  <li>Angular Material </li>
  <li>Azure Static Web App</li>  
</ul>
